Motivation
----------

UNICAST has issues when one end of the connnection unilaterally closes the connection and discards the state in
the connection table.

Example: we have a conn between A and B. There's a partition such that A sees {A,B} and
B sees only {B}. B will clear its connection table for A on reception of the view, whereas A will keep it.

Now the partition heals and A and B can communicate again.

Assuming A's next seqno to B is #25 (and #7 for receiving messages from B),
B will store the message because it expects #1 from A (new connection).

The reverse direction is even worse: B will send #1 to A, but A expects #7, so A will discard the message.
